# Candy Crush Type Game

This game is created after the style of the popular Candy Crush.
While more basic, it is similar in nature: match three or more characters, receive points, the board changes.

## My Contribution and What I Learned

Matching anything is incredibly satisfying to me, so this was another game I naturally wanted to try to make. Again, with the assitance of a tutorial I made the game start to finish. However, this time I tried to write down what I thought the steps would be first. When it went a different direction, I paused the video and tried to recalibrate my thinking and take another stab at it. While I was gaining confidence in my skills, I still needed some direction on what to build and I love games so I went this route. As noted in another project, I found coming up with something out of thin air was difficult after gleaning so much from classes. This was a fun way to implement what I'd learned and see positive results! 

The key takeaways for me with this project:
- There's always another way to do something - it's important to keep your mind open to possibilities
- Understanding the way this game operates is going to be helpful in working on more complex projects in the future. While this is in context of a game, the code can be utilized in other ways like business!
- There's always going to be a lot to learn

# React + Vite

This provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Installation

Use the clone option located under the green 'Code' button. Alternately, you may download the zip file and extract the files locally. 
Once cloned, use the node package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install the necessary files.
